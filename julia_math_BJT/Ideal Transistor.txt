Ideal Transistor
The basic solid state amplification devices are bipolar, JFET and MOSFET transistors.  
All of them can be considered as transconductance device, which is a current source controlled by a voltage.

A bipolar transistor has a diode input structure: 
    the input voltage between the base and the emitter sees a 
    small signal resistance of VT/Ib, where VT=kT/q is the thermal voltage, about 26mV at the room temperature 
    and the Ib is the base bias current, usually in the 10μA range, 
    so the resistance rb is about 2.6KΩ.   
    A voltage vbe, that generates ib=vbe/rb, 
    would cause a collector-emitter current ic=βib=βvbe/rb; 
    so the transconductance is gm=β/rb. 
    With β around 100, the transductance is about 40mA/V. 
    Another way to look at it is an ideal transistor with re=1/gm at its emitter. 
    An ideal transistor is to have an infinite transconductance, 
    which implies that vbe approaches zero.

    Let's use this model for the three basic amplifier configurations.  
    The gain of the common-emitter amplifier with emitter degeneration, −RC/(re+RE). 
    re is about 25Ω, which is generally much less than RE, 
    so the gain simplifies to −RC/RE, independent of the transistor parameters.  
    For the common-collection amplifier or the follower, 
    the gain is a simple voltage divider, RE/(re+RE)=1/(1+re/RE)≈1.  
    For the common-base amplifier, the gain is re/RC.

Now we have raised the concept of an ideal transistor, let's be more clear.  
The transconductance is infinite.  
Because we have been using the small-signal model, 
which is a linearized model around the bias point, we have ignored the biasing.  
An ideal transistor would require no biasing, no input current into the base  
and the emitter current is bi-directional, flowing both in and out the emitter.   
Such an ideal transistor has been approximated by an integrated circuit that 
is called an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) or a diamond transistor.   
One example is Burr-Brown (TI)'s OPA860.  
It has a high impedance input as the base and a bi-directional emitter and requires no bias.  
The transconductance is adjustable, but is around 100 mA/V or equivalently re=10Ω.  
So the transconductance gain is not quite infinite, but re is small enough compared to RE.
